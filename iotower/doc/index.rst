Introduction
============

IOTower is a reimplementation of Kevin Lenzo's famous Infobot as a
Yardbird app.  Infobots were originally meant to sit idle in a channel
and listen for declarative statements containing the verbs "is" or
"are", then spit this tidbit of knowledge back at the channel if someone
asks the right question.  

IOTower mimics a helpful (if slightly eccentric) user through a database
of "factoids" that associate triggers with responses.

IOTower is part of the Yardbird core project, and can be downloaded as a

        * `The IOTower Specification`_ is a command-line demonstration
          of the behavior of the bot, and is used for doctests by the
