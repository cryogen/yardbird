1. YARDBIRD:

GENERAL TODO:

* add comments to regexes in commands.py
	* does order matter? I assume so. explain order reasoning.
* comments to the general code would be nice.

OPEN DESIGN QUESTIONS:

* what's the best way to handle "tags"?
* how should we handle aliasing?
	* suggested f->r->f reference which opens future possibilities

STILL TO BE IMPLEMENTED:

* ignore
* unignore
* list_ignored
* netsplit handling
* additional event handling:
	* topic
	* others?

PACKAGING:

* two packages, one just yardbird, one with iotower
* includes manage.py script for installing yardbird

2. IOTOWER:

TO BE IMPLEMENTED:

* forget
* undo:
	* undo-delete
	* undo-insert
	* undo-edit
* redo:
	* redo-delete
	* redo-insert
	* redo-edit
* protect factoid
* unprotect_factoid
* alias factoid
* unalias factoid
* search

OTHER FEATURES?:

* bot "personalities", e.g. "it is only by the grace of the users"

YARDBIRD HAS; INFOBOT LACKS (gee whiz factor):

* =verb= as in pedro =loves= tacos
	* what does pedro love? (tacos).
* context: stabs {{nick}}

INFOBOT HAS; YARDBIRD LACKS (potential gripes):

* "also" adds to response set, not adds "and" clause to single response
	* present in dumont for some time
* no you/your/my substitution
	* thank gord
* 07:20 <@SpaceHobo> although part of the fun is factoids we've
	hammered into dumont that assume that words like 'where' and 'wtf' and
	'who' are all the same and are removed
	* what is this?
* different regex behavior for editing
	* no big deal
* what gotchas are out there that people may not like?

POLICY QUESTIONS:

* you must address the bot to delete (forget) a factoid
* different permissions issues
	* do you need trust to delete or edit, for example?
* protected factoids 
* undo/redo
* what other policy changes?
* probably should protect tell and vox by policy as well

OTHER QUESTIONS:

* do we have an auto-response threshold by factoid length?

3. OTHER YARDBIRD APPLICATIONS SEPARATE FROM IOTOWER:

* "seen" application
* botsnack
* stats
* yow, tom, etc.
* "..." crickets module
* tell
* vox puppetting
